# anilistxmltotext
Script that neatly saves the titles of every manga/anime entry of a user in a text file.
- For MAL users: MAL has a built-in export feature on their [site](https://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export).
- For AniList users: since they currently don't have an in-site list export feature, use this tool [here](https://malscraper.azurewebsites.net/) that scrapes and stores list data in the same format as MAL's for later use. 
- For Kitsu users: use the same tool as Anilist users to scrape your data into MAL's XML format; Kitsu uses their own format that does not include media titles but rather ID numbers.
