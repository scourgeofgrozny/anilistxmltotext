# anilistxmltotext
Script that parses through AL/MAL/Kitsu XML animanga data and produces a list of titles<br>
#### How to get an XML file of your data:
- MAL has a built-in export data in XML feature on their [site](https://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export).
- AniList: since they currently don't have an in-site export feature, use this tool [here](https://malscraper.azurewebsites.net/) that scrapes and stores list data in the same format as MAL's for later use. 
- Kitsu: Same as Anilist; Kitsu uses their own format that does not include media titles but rather ID numbers.
